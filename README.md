Minimize individual carbon footprint without reducing quality of life

The 'Data_Mining' jupyter notebook (python) file takes the original data set and breaks it into multiple csv files.

The 'Unsupervised' notebook then reads these digested files, does some further wrangling to produce metrics such as total individual carbon footprint. A few more exploratory things are tried including a few unsupervised clustering algorithms. I also made a people class that grabs all the data for each individual, which could be used by an individual to see their carbon footprint broken down by activity.
